•	User authentication: Users should be required to create an account and log in to use the application.
•	Data persistence: Notes should be saved to a database and retrieved when the user logs in.

Design:
The website should have a clean and simple design that focuses on the note-taking functionality. The colour scheme should be light and modern, with clear typography and intuitive navigation.




Technical Requirements:
1.	The website should be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2.	User authentication should be implemented using a secure, industry-standard authentication framework.
3.	Notes should be saved to a database using a server-side language such as PHP or Node.js.

Conclusion:
The note-taking website we will build together will provide users with an intuitive and visually appealing way to create, edit, and manage their notes. With a focus on functionality and usability, this website will meet the needs of users who require a simple yet powerful note-taking solution.
